# Loan Repayment Schedule

## Overview
This is an web application that calculates the installment amounts for long term loans, given a loan amount, interest rate, and tenure of the loan. The user can also choose the repayment frequency-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. The default for repayment frequency is annual repayment. The loan repayment is calculated based on the end-of month payment [ordinary annuity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryannuity.asp). On successful entry of required data, a [amortization schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_schedule) is generated based on the information provided.

## Technologies Used
I have used the following technologies to build the application:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Document Object Model (DOM)
* Bootstrap 4

## Instructions to Use
Please follow these instructions to generate a loan payment schedule:
* Enter the amount of loan you are considering in the "Amount" field
* Enter the interest rate for that loan without the percentage sign in "Interest" field
* Enter the duration of the loan in terms of year(s) in "Tenure" field
* Select the frequency of your loan repayment installments from "Frequency" field **(default value is "Annually")**
* After you have entered all the required fields, press "Calculate" to calculate and generate the repayment schedule
* You can press the "Clear" button to clear the whole page and start fresh again
